  name: "NEX-Forms â€“ Ultimate Form Builder <= 7.9.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The NEX-Forms WordPress plugin through 7.9.7 does not escape some of its settings and form fields before outputting them in attributes, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. Tested in version 7.9.7 and is still vulnerable."
