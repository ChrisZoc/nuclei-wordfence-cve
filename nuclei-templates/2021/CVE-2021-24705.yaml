id: CVE-2021-24705

info:
  name: "NEX-Forms â€“ Ultimate Form Builder <= 7.9.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: "The NEX-Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.9.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_record() function, in addition to many other functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
