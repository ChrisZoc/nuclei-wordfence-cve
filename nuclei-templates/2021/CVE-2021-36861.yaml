info:
  name: "Rich Reviews by Starfish <= 1.9.14 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: "The Rich Reviews by Starfish plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.14. This is due to missing nonce validation on the process_bulk_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bulk process reviews via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
