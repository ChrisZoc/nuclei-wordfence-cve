info:
  name: "Uji Countdown <= 2.2 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The Uji Countdown plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's settings in versions up to, and including, 2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for administrator-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
