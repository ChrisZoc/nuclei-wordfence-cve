info:
  name: "Page scroll to id <= 1.7.5 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The Page scroll to id plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via one of its shortcode attributes in versions up to, and including, 1.7.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
