id: CVE-2022-2891

info:
  name: "WP 2FA <= 2.2.1 - Time-Based TOTP attack to Sensitive Information Exposure"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The WP 2FA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 due to the use of a linear-time comparison operator when comparing token hashes. This allows an attacker to gain information about authentication tokens by observing small time differences in server response times. This is a vulnerability that is generally not realistically exploitable over the internet due to other factors that will have a greater influence on response times."
