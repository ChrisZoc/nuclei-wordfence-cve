id: CVE-2022-4059

info:
  name: Cryptocurrency Widgets Pack <= 1.8.1 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: Critical
  description: The Cryptocurrency Widgets Pack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via one of its AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on an existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
