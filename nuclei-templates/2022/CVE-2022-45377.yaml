  name: Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce <= 1.0.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery in upload and delete_file
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the upload and delete_file functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized file upload or deletion via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
