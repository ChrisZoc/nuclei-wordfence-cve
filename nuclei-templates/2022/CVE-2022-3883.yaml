id: CVE-2022-3883

info:
  name: "StopBadBots <= 7.23 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Plugin Installation"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The StopBadBots plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the stopbadbots_install_plugin() function in versions up to, and including, 3.04. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permission, such as a subscriber, to install arbitrary plugins on the vulnerable site. This could be used to install additional vulnerable plugins that could aid in further compromise of the site."
