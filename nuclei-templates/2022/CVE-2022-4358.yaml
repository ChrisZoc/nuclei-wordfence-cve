id: CVE-2022-4358

info:
  name: "WP RSS By Publishers <= 0.1 - Authenticated (Admin+) SQL Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: "The WP RSS By Publishers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via an unspecified parameter in versions up to, and including, 0.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for administrator-level attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
