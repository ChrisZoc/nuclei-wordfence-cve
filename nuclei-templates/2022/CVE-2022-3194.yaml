id: CVE-2022-3194

info:
  name: Dokan <= 3.6.3 - Authenticated (Vendor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: The Dokan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via product reviews in versions up to, and including, 3.6.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with vendor permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was the result of the plugin enabling unfiltered_html capabilities for this user role.
