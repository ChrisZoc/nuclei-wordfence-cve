info:
  name: Activity Reactions For Buddypress <= 1.0.22 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: The Activity Reactions For Buddypress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.22. This is due to missing nonce validation on the ai_front_smiley() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disabled and enable reactions granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
