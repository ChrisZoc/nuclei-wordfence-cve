  name: "Video Conferencing with Zoom <= 4.0.9 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The Video Conferencing with Zoom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via shortcode in versions up to, and including, 4.0.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
