id: CVE-2017-18606

info:
  name: "Avada <= 5.1.4 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via avada_portfolio_category_slug parameter saved by the save_permalink_settings() function called via 'admin_init' in versions up to 5.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
