id: CVE-2012-5318

info:
  name: "Kish Guest Posting <= 1.2 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Critical
  description: "The Kish Guest Posting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation when double extensions are supplied in the uploadify/scripts/uploadify.php file in versions up to, and including, 1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1125."
