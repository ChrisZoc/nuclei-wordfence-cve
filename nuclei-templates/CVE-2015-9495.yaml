id: CVE-2015-9495

info:
  name: "Syndication Links < 1.0.3 - DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The Syndication Links plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting via the genericons/example.html anchor identifier in versions up to 1.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
