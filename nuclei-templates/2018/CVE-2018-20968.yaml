  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: "The Export WordPress Data with Advanced Filters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the export_module() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export module data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
