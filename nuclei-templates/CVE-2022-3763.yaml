info:
  name: Booster Elite for WooCommerce < 1.1.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: The Booster Elite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, but not including, 1.1.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete files uploaded during a check-out, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
