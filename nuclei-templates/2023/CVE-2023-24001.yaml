info:
  name: "Modal Dialog <= 3.5.9 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The Modal Dialog plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.5.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
