id: CVE-2023-0448

info:
  name: "WP Helper Premium <= 4.2.0 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: Medium
  description: "The WP Helper Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the GET data returned to a user via the surveySubmit_func() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
