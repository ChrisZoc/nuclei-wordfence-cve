id: CVE-2020-29395

info:
  name: "EventON <= 3.0.5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The EventON plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 3.0.5. This is due to insufficient escaping and sanitization on the q= parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note this only affects the premium version of this plugin."
