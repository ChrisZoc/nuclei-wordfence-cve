id: CVE-2023-23879

info:
  name: "PHP Execution <= 1.0.0 - Cross Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: "The PHP Execution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/php_execution_admin.php function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable the ability for users with low-level privileged users to trigger PHP,  via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
