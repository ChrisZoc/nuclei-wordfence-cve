  name: "WP Coder <= 2.5.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: "The WP Coder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the ~/admin/partials/tools-data-base.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete code created by the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
