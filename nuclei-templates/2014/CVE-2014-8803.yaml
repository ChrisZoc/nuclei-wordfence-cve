  name: "Smart Forms – when you need more than just a contact form <= 2.1.0 - Missing Authorization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: High
  description: "The Smart Forms – when you need more than just a contact form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the rednao_smart_forms_save_form_values function in versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit forms, including entering stored cross-site scripting, as output is not properly escaped."
